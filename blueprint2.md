# Project Blueprint
## 1. Overview
This document outlines the project's style, design, and features, from its initial version to the current one. It also details the plan for the latest requested changes. This application is a mobile e-commerce platform named "KZL Shop" that allows users to browse products by category, add them to a cart, and view their orders. It includes a separate interface for admins to manage products and categories.

## 2. Style, Design, and Features

### Version 1.0 (Initial)
*   **Firebase Setup:** Initialized Firebase Core, Auth, and Firestore.
*   **User Roles:** Implemented user and admin roles using Firestore.
*   **Authentication:** Created login and signup screens.
*   **Admin Panel:** Basic interface for admins to add/edit/delete products and categories.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Bottom navigation bar for Home, Cart, and Orders.
    *   Home screen with a category carousel and a product grid.
    *   Product detail screen.
    *   Cart screen to view and manage items.
    *   My Orders screen for users to see their order history.

### Version 1.1
*   **UI/UX Improvement:** Addressed an issue where the product list would flicker and disappear when a category was selected.
    *   **Created `lib/widgets/product_grid.dart`:** Implemented a dedicated `StatefulWidget` to handle fetching and displaying products.
    *   **Data Caching:** The new `ProductGrid` widget caches the last successfully loaded product list to prevent it from disappearing while the new category's products are being fetched. This ensures a smoother user experience.
    *   **Refactored `home_screen.dart`:** Updated the home screen to use the new `ProductGrid` widget, passing the `_selectedCategoryId` to it.

### Version 1.2
*   **Product Card UI Enhancement:** Fixed an issue where long product names were truncated in the product card.
    *   **Modified `lib/widgets/product_card.dart`:** Updated the `Text` widget for the product name to have `maxLines: 2` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`. This allows product names to wrap to a second line if needed, improving readability.

### Version 1.3
*   **Title Styling:** Enhanced the visual hierarchy on the home screen by adding a subtle shadow effect to the section titles.
    *   **Modified `lib/screens/user/home_screen.dart`:** Applied a `TextStyle` with a `shadows` property to the "Categories" and "Products" `Text` widgets, giving them an embossed, "lifted" appearance.

### Version 1.4 (Current)
*   **Layout Adjustment:** Improved the density of the product grid to display more items on the screen.
    *   **Modified `lib/widgets/product_grid.dart`:**
        *   Changed the `crossAxisCount` of the `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount` from `2` to `3`.
        *   Adjusted the `childAspectRatio` to `0.65` to ensure the product cards have a proper, slightly taller layout.
        *   Reduced the `padding` and `spacing` of the grid to accommodate the extra column gracefully.

## 3. Plan for Current Request
**Task:** Save the project history and latest changes into a new blueprint file.
*   **Action:** Create a new file named `blueprint2.md`.
*   **Content:**
    *   Document the initial setup and all subsequent feature enhancements and UI fixes.
    *   Detail the fixes for the flickering product list, the two-line product name wrapping, the embossed title styling, and the change to a 3-column product grid.
*   **Status:** Completed.
